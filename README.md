# ST NUCLEO-G071RB Base Project

This project is built on VScode using the PlatformIO Plugin. It includes blinky in both src and test as examples.

- Code between src and test is not shared.
- The lib directory is common between src and test so it is perfect for sharing code between them.
- The test structurs is setup in a way that allows for pair files for each module to test.
